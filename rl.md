# Reinforcement Learning readings


### Overview
1. [DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING: AN OVERVIEW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07274.pdf)<br/>
`--A good review to briefly summarize the latest work on deep RL.`


### Hierarchical RL
1. [Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Temporal Abstraction and Intrinsic Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06057)<br/>
`--A top-level value function (meta controller) learns a policy over subgoals, and a low-level function (controller) learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goal.`
2. [Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1oK8aoxe)<br/>
`--First learn a span of skills in a pre-training environment, then train high-level policies over these skills in the downstream tasks.`
